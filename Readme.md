* Right-click on the Aerial screen saver in System Preferences and select `Delete "Aerial"`.
* Or delete the file(s) directly. macOS can store screen savers in two locations. `/Library/Screen Savers` and `/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Screen Savers`. Check both locations for a file called "Aerial.saver" and delete any copies you find.

## Aerial Installed by default with project. 

If you only want Aerial as a screensaver without the desktop change, simply open **Uninstall.app**<br>
and you are done! The afterward uninstall steps are for removing the Aerial Screensaver.
